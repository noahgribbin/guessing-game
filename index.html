		<h1>Guessing Game!</h1>
		<p>On this page the JavaScrip prompts the user for several things. First it prompts for the users name. Second, it prompts the user for thier answers to several questions. These are yes or no questions. A variable is created to serve as the correct answer, and an if statment checks to see if the users input is equal to the correct answer. If the user input matches the correct answer it adds 1 to a variable which tracks the number of correct answers. This variable starts at 0 and if every question is answered correctly it can get up to 3. Depending on the number of correct answers a differnt alert will pop up telling the user how many questions they answered correctly. If any questions were not answered correctly an alert will pop up after the game is completed and let the user know the correct answer. Lastly an alert will pop up thanking the user for playing the game. </p>
